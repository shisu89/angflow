# @angflow/angular

## Unreleased (next minor)

### Added

- `<ng-flow>` `[autoPanOnNodeFocus]` input (default `true`) — pans the viewport
  when a node receives keyboard focus, matching React's `autoPanOnNodeFocus`.
- Selection box is now draggable as a group and keyboard-movable (arrow keys,
  Shift = 4×, Escape clears the selection), matching React's `NodesSelection`.

### Removed

- `(autoPanStart)` / `(autoPanEnd)` outputs. They were declared "Not yet wired",
  never emitted, and have no React equivalent. Removed as never-functional API.

## 0.2.0

Current release (group auto-size: `getGroupBounds` + `sizeGroupToChildren`).
